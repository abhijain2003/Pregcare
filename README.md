# PregCare

## 💡 Inspiration

Pregnancy can be a hard and stressful journey for many women as there are so many factors that influence it, such as eating right, getting enough vitamins and nutrients, etc. Furthermore, many women experience symptoms of depression and loneliness as their bodies are undergoing numerous hormonal changes. This inspired us to create a web app, which would allow pregnant women to connect with doctors and keep track of their mental and physical health.

## 💻 What it does

PregCare is a web app that connects pregnant women to medical professionals and counselors. Pregnant women can create an account and keep track of their daily symptoms and feelings, through a virtual diary. This diary also tracks how much vitamin D they are getting as this vitamin is very important for healthy child development. Moreover, the web app allows patients to find medical professionals and book an appointment. They can also directly contact other pregnant women, in their private chatroom. We want to help pregnant women to be able to manage their health and have a smooth pregnancy journey!
